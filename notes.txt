NECESSARY for core functionality:

  way to link entities. think smart and dont be afraid to hack something
together for minimum viable product. After MVP, think hard about how memory is
layed out to make some elegant thing.

EVENTUALLY after core functionality is complete and you feel like it:

  figure out where to use inline to improve performance and check other common
optimizations.

  create more sophisticated memory shit to reduce reallocation, such as leaving
some empty memory after each entity to leave room for adding more components
